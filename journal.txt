First sample is all done, but second sample is coming along as well. Here are my ideas:
  first of all, I need to remember to draw them on paper first, or come up with pseudocode or written description
  still would like white slanted lines with static position toward the bottom, working together with a slanted white-transparent gradient to transition the background image to white (or off-white)
  still would like better background images (semi-opaque parallelograms) for each grid item
  second sample could float sidebar left
  could play with #content-container being a flexbox
  would be nice to have a pretty vertical line separating the sidebar and the content
  figure out an icon indicating to scroll
  need an image behind #splash
  can possibly get rid of grid-gap if keeping as a grid
  
  third sample would have a persistent navbar at the top
    figure out animating relative to scroll position

Michael selected the first sample, we're going with this design. Here's a workflow for me to get started on:
1. Design
  Making sure that the design is suitable and makes for a pleasant viewing/webbrowsing experience. It should work well with the Django implementation in order for it to become a template.
2. Django backend
  Requirements center around high modulability: 
    Modular features required:
      All featured images (banners, splash, etc)
        These will have to be fully thought/fleshed out. There will have to be a model with a filefield that has the maximum of ONE record. Templates will have to be able to pick up the URL of this uploaded static file and serve it.
      All text features (blog, announcements, etc)
  We also need to know how to Djangoify Michael's calendar setup.
3. Implementation
  Template implementation of html
  PythonAnywhere account setup, venv setup
  
The only trouble area here are the image models, which will require some reading up.

Working on django models, have fleshed out a way to make only one instance possible, need to recreate this with images and find a way to serve static images.

Still need a solution for the django calendar.

First sample is all done, but second sample is coming along as well. Here are my ideas:
  first of all, I need to remember to draw them on paper first, or come up with pseudocode or written description
  still would like white slanted lines with static position toward the bottom, working together with a slanted white-transparent gradient to transition the background image to white (or off-white)
  still would like better background images (semi-opaque parallelograms) for each grid item
  second sample could float sidebar left
  could play with #content-container being a flexbox
  would be nice to have a pretty vertical line separating the sidebar and the content
  figure out an icon indicating to scroll
  need an image behind #splash
  can possibly get rid of grid-gap if keeping as a grid
  
  third sample would have a persistent navbar at the top
    figure out animating relative to scroll position
